TODO LIST: 

==================
Short-Term
==================

  - [ ] Write some unit tests

  - [ ] Allow the picker to position itself _above_ the textbox if the
    registered text input is too close to the bottom of the page. 

==================
Mid-Term
==================
  - [ ] Start looking into how to make this into a chrome extension (hopefully
    this will even be allowed to be an extension). Setup chrome extension
    locally.

  - [ ] Ensure this works on non-textbox elements that act as textboxes (by
    using the role="textbox" attribute, or some other method). Look at Gmail as
    an example. Apparently we could use the `window.getSelection()` function to
    help us out here with divs who are contenteditable (which I am guessing is
    usually paired with role="textbox")

  - [ ] Look different ways to get the exact location of the caret in a `textarea`
    besides using the "textarea-caret" package. This might be the only way.

  - [ ] Test Emoji character ranges to ensure the emoji library and Noto are
    displaying them all correctly. Write a test script / html page to do this

  - [ ] Profile the crap out of this and make more tasks to try and reduce 
  resource consumption as muich as possible 

  - [ ] Optimize to allocate less memory. For example:
    * keep references to the suggestion elements, and stop inserting new divs each time.
    * stop recreating empty arrays upon every button press.


==================
Long-Term
==================

  - [ ] Optimize search to prefer frequently used emojis first.

  - [ ] Look into aliasing common words to other emojis that make sense in the
    context. :hello => "waving hand"

  - [ ] Look into compressing the emoji data file further 

  - [ ] Allow users to set basic opt-in / opt-out settings for specific urls.
    Also allow global opt-in / opt-out settings. 

  - [ ] Allow users to choose the preferred color tone for people emojis
    (Extension Setting).

  - [ ] Allow users to choose the preferred emoji scheme for the picker display
    (Extension Setting).

  - [ ] Allow users alias emojis (Extension Setting).

  - [ ] Allow users to load emoji picker on demand rather than automatically 
    appearing (ctrl+space command) (Extension Setting).

  - [ ] Improve the fuzzy search functionality by adding more options. 
    Add "character miss tolerances" to short-circuit searching.

  - [ ] Eventually evaluate if Typescript would be better to use, since there
    might be less ceremony around debugging babel related issues. I don't think
    I need to get plugins for all of the es6 features I need when using TS.

  - [ ] Look into other browser extension platforms (firefox?)
