TODO LIST: 

==================
Short-Term
==================
  - [ ] Make the picker appear below the textbox area (absolute positioning with
    a high z-index)

==================
Mid-Term
==================
  - [ ] Start looking into how to make this into a chrome extension (hopefully
    this will even be allowed to be an extension). Setup chrome extension
    locally.

  - [ ] Add support for allowing fixes to the emoji search text. This means
    something like fixing ":smle" to ":smile". Since the arrow keys are being
    captured during the listening state, the only way we could fix this without
    backspacing is to use the mose to change the selection location, and make an
    edit in between the text. Currently this does not work at all

  - [ ] Reorganize files
  
  - [ ] Emoji character range needs to be adjusted, the range is not covering
    all of the emojis outlined in https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-12.0/full-emoji-list.html.
    For example none of the flags on the bottom of that site are appearing in
    the Noto font.

  - [ ] Change the fuzzysearch function to prefer exact substring matches first.
    We probably have to implement, or use a package, that efficently calculates
    the "Levenshtein distance", or that tracks the amount of gaps between the
    letters, which we can use to order the results better.

  - [ ] Eventually evaluate if Typescript would be better to use, since there
    might be less ceremony around debugging babel related issues. I don't think
    I need to get plugins for all of the es6 features I need when using TS.

  - [ ] Let's try to expand the picker to be more "grid" like, so we can use
    both horizontal and veritcal space. 

  - [ ] Write some selenium tests

  - [ ] Write some unit tests

==================
Long-Term
==================
  - [ ] Optimize to allocate less memory. For example:
    * keep references to the suggestion elements, and stop inserting new divs each time.
    * stop recreating empty arrays upon every button press.

  - [ ] Optimize search to prefer frequently used emojis first.
  - [ ] Ensure this works on non-textbox elements that act as textboxes (by
    using the role="textbox" attribute, or some other method). Look at Gmail as
    an example. I imagine searching for the current cursor will be hard here.

  - [ ] Allow users to set basic opt-in / opt-out settings for specific urls.
    Also allow global opt-in / opt-out settings. 
  - [ ] Allow users to choose the preferred color tone for people emojis
    (Extension Setting).
  - [ ] Allow users to choose the preferred emoji scheme for the picker display
    (Extension Setting).
  - [ ] Allow users alias emojis (Extension Setting).
  - [ ] Allow users to load emoji picker on demand rather than automatically 
    appearing (ctrl+space command) (Extension Setting).

  - [ ] Look into other browser extension platforms (firefox?)
