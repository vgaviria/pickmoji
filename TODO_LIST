TODO LIST: 

==================
Short-Term
==================
  - [ ] Capture the arrow key events and tab to navigate the emoji suggestions. 
    emoji choices.
  - [ ] Start styling the emoji picker

==================
Mid-Term
==================
  - [ ] Start looking into how to make this into a chrome extension (hopefully
    this will even be allowed to be an extension). Setup chrome extension
    locally.

  - [ ] Reorganize files
  
  - [ ] Emoji character range needs to be adjusted, the range is not covering
    all of the emojis outlined in https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-12.0/full-emoji-list.html.
    For example none of the flags on the bottom of that site are appearing in
    the Noto font.

  - [ ] Change the fuzzysearch function to prefer exact substring matches first.
    We probably have to implement, or use a package, that efficently calculates
    the "Levenshtein distance", or that tracks the amount of gaps between the
    letters, which we can use to order the results better.

  - [ ] Eventually evaluate if Typescript would be better to use, since there
    might be less ceremony around debugging babel related issues. I don't think
    I need to get plugins for all of the es6 features I need when using TS.

  - [ ] Write some selenium tests

  - [ ] Write some unit tests

==================
Long-Term
==================
  - [ ] Optimize to allocate less memory. For example:
    * keep references to the suggestion elements, and stop inserting new divs each time.
    * stop recreating empty arrays upon every button press.

  - [ ] Optimize search to prefer frequently used emojis first.
  - [ ] Ensure this works on non-textbox elements that act as textboxes (by
    using the role="textbox" attribute, or some other method). Look at Gmail as
    an example. I imagine searching for the current cursor will be hard here.

  - [ ] Allow users to set basic opt-in / opt-out settings for specific urls.
    Also allow global opt-in / opt-out settings. 
  - [ ] Allow users to choose the preferred color tone for people emojis
    (Extension Setting).
  - [ ] Allow users to choose the preferred emoji scheme for the picker display
    (Extension Setting).
  - [ ] Allow users alias emojis (Extension Setting).
  - [ ] Allow users to load emoji picker on demand rather than automatically 
    appearing (ctrl+space command) (Extension Setting).

  - [ ] Look into other browser extension platforms (firefox?)
